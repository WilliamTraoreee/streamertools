		'The Maono PD400X is a high quality dynamic cardioid microphone with USB AND XLR output. You can control and mute mic directly on it. So it\'s plug-n-play but it allows you to step-up over a sound-card/amplifier over XLR. It comes with USB-C cable, XLR cable, a foam windscreen and a heavy micro holder.',
